         <p> Happy birthday, Aarthi!
            I guess it’s your first birthday without us. I still remember how you used to visit us on your birthday, or how I would give you presents before going to school. It still sucks to think I can’t see you on your birthday. But worry not — I’ll visit you and Athul anna at your new house very soon.
            
            Sorry for not giving you the best gift this time. I initially planned to develop a more advanced website with more colors and pages for your birthday — but guess what, time is sacred.
            You’re one of the main reasons I started learning web development. At first, I was thinking about what gift I could give you, but since it couldn’t reach you physically in time, I thought of the internet — and web pages came right into my mind.
            
            I started learning HTML and CSS on April 10th, which took me about 7 hours. Developing the website took me around 3 more hours. If only I’d gotten the idea a bit earlier, I could’ve made an even more amazing page. But hey, let’s not dwell on the past.
            
            Once again, Happy Birthday, Aarthi!✨✨</p>

            <p>To Aarthi 
                You were my first secret keeper,
                My safe place on quiet days.
                With Frozen songs ❄ and “anaconda maavu” —
                Who names a snack like that, anyways?
                
                When mom had errands and left me with you, you’d take me in —
                With snacks, laughs, and soft cartoons 🍿
                We built a world so warm, so close,
                That ended all too soon.
                
                You moved away, I flew abroad ✈
                Life wrote new lines for us both.
                We missed a few pages in between,
                But love still lingers—quiet and growth.
                
                You’re married now, and glowing bright ✨
                In your own little world that feels just right.
                You’ve found your Panda—and I just smile,
                Thinking of us, and this new mile.
                And though our stories don’t always align,
                You’ll always be a part of mine ❤
                
                Happy Birthday, Aarthi
                To the one who made my childhood sweet 🍭
                And whose smile still feels like a familiar beat.</p>
